# hello-world

My first GitHub encounter program.

I am a qualified chartered accountant. In pursuant of my ambition to convert tractors, combines and other farm machinery/equipment into autonomous farm vehicles, I enrolled for a BSc Computer Science with the University of London, on-line program. In addition, I will be pursuing Machine Leaning (ML), Computer Vision and Ibternet of Things. I have a fair working knowledge of the following programming languages: javaScript, python, java and C++.
